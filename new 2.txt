How to use CD4013B instead of ne555p used in bistable mode that acts as a SR Latch?

To use a CD4013B instead of an NE555P in bistable mode that acts as an SR latch, you will need to connect the pins of the CD4013B in a certain way to replicate the behavior of the NE555P.

Here is a step-by-step guide:

Connect Vcc (pin 14) and GND (pin 7) to the power supply and ground, respectively.

Connect the Set (S) input (pin 4) to one of the inputs of the SR latch, and connect the Reset (R) input (pin 10) to the other input of the SR latch.

Connect the Q output (pin 1) to the output of the SR latch.

Connect the inverted Q output (pin 2) to the other input of the SR latch.

Connect the Clock (CLK) input (pin 3) to a stable logic level, such as GND or Vcc. This will make the latch operate in a stable state.

Connect the Data (D) input (pin 5) to the input of the SR latch that is not connected to the Set or Reset inputs.

Connect the Enable (EN) input (pin 13) to Vcc to enable the latch.

With these connections, the CD4013B will behave as an SR latch in bistable mode. When the Set input is high and the Reset input is low, the output Q will be high and the inverted output Q will be low. When the Set input is low and the Reset input is high, the output Q will be low and the inverted output Q will be high. In both cases, the latch will remain in that state until the inputs are changed.
